# battle-console
a small demo ship game using C#. Click around and try to sink the enemy's single boat, before they destroy yours.

# Getting The Code

* `git clone https://github.com/erikyuzwa/battle-console.git`

# Background

Wanted to compete in the [7DRL](http://7drl.roguetemple.com/) competition and to do THAT, I wanted to
put together a small demo using SadConsole to learn / eval how things
are working. 

I like this package quite a bit and am enjoying what it's bringing to
the table.
